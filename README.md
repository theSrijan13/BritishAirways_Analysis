# Introduction
This README provides an overview of the exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted on the British Airways flight operations dataset. The aim of this EDA is to understand the underlying patterns, trends, and anomalies in the flight operations data to provide actionable insights.

# Objectives
Understand the distribution and characteristics of flight operations.
Identify trends and patterns in flight delays and cancellations.
Analyze the performance of different routes and aircraft types.
Discover any potential operational inefficiencies.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes information on British Airways flight operations. The key features of the dataset are:

FlightNumber: Unique identifier for each flight.
Date: Date of the flight.
DepartureAirport: Airport code of the departure location.
ArrivalAirport: Airport code of the arrival location.
ScheduledDepartureTime: Scheduled time for departure.
ActualDepartureTime: Actual time of departure.
ScheduledArrivalTime: Scheduled time for arrival.
ActualArrivalTime: Actual time of arrival.
AircraftType: Type of aircraft used.
Status: Status of the flight (On-time, Delayed, Cancelled).
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

# Data Cleaning
Before starting the analysis, the data was cleaned to handle missing values, incorrect data formats, and any anomalies. The following steps were taken:

Handling Missing Values: Missing values in critical columns were either imputed or dropped.
Data Type Conversion: Ensured all date and time columns were in the correct datetime format.
Removing Duplicates: Removed any duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
## EDA Steps
1. Descriptive Statistics
Summary statistics of numerical columns.
Distribution of categorical variables.
2. Time Series Analysis
Trends in flight operations over time.
Seasonal patterns in flight delays and cancellations.
3. Flight Performance Analysis
Analysis of on-time performance.
Distribution of delays by departure and arrival airports.
Analysis of delays by aircraft type.
4. Route Analysis
Most popular routes.
Routes with the highest delays and cancellations.
5. Visualizations
Histograms and boxplots for numerical features.
Bar charts for categorical features.
Line plots for time series analysis.
Heatmaps for correlation analysis.
Key Findings
Flight Delays: Identified peak times and days when delays are most frequent.
Route Efficiency: Highlighted routes with consistent on-time performance and those with frequent delays.
Aircraft Performance: Evaluated which aircraft types are most prone to delays.

# Conclusion
The EDA of British Airways flight operations provided significant insights into the factors affecting flight performance. These insights can be used to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

# Future Work
Predictive Modeling: Develop models to predict flight delays and cancellations.
Deep Dive Analysis: Further analysis on specific routes or time periods with high delay rates.
Operational Recommendations: Provide detailed recommendations based on EDA findings.
